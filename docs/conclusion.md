Given its small scale and time limit, I've over complicated the project, especially in the setup part. 

# Features

- TypeScript, promise
- REST API Endpoints
- REST API Tests with Postman
- ExpressJS app connected to Lambda
- Webpack and livereload
- Middleware
- Offline development

# AWS Lambda 

It's a lot like the [Cloud Function](https://docs.leancloud.app/leanengine_cloudfunction_guide-node.html) feature by [Parse](Parse.com) and [LeanCloud](LeanCloud.cn), on **STEROIDS**! 

Liked it.

# AWS DynamoDB

While is'a pain in the back to setup, it has its values

- Fine tuning permisison via IAM 
- Fast indexing
- Query and nested query
- Good for scalable projects

Did not hate it.

# Serverless

Even though it took a while to setup, it's a great structure. 

- Enables local development
- Enables easy deployment
- Maintains independence to AWS stack, reduces risk.

Loved it.

# What went wrong / took too much time

- Serverless Local dev setup debugging
- DynamoDB and structuring
- Wrapping my head around making Serverless/Express work together with Lambda

# Todos

Due to time constraint, many features are left as 'idea'. 
A `todo` had been added to comments.     

# What would I have done differently?

**Given time limit**, I should have used MEAN stack, since I'm more familiar with it.

- Use MongoDB for Ultra-Fast Quick Start
- Use a MEAN Full Stack Yoeman/Starterkit
- Deploy to Heroku, or DigitalOcean Apps
